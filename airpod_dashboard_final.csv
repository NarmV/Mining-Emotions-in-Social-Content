Gestures and Misc.Fit and ComfortThese are very comfortable. However, having no ANC or Transparency mode while travelling, you may feel air pressure.Audio QualityThe soundstage is indescribable for a pair of TWS, a bit better than Sony WF1000XM4. They have very high clarity, you can hear instruments separation clearly. No distortion even in high volumes. The but part is the bass is still much lower when compared to Sonys. Here, high frequency bass is lower, mid bass is very clear and adequate for all the genres. I tried setting custom eq which is under accessibility settings, but still the bass is just low. The music app eq can be set to increase bass, but you will just lose the clarity if you change that eq, so I set it to off.ANCIt is right on the top tier with Sony, a bit better on Sony in own experience tho.Transparency modeIt is in a league of its own, far superior than others. You basically wont feel that you have TWS on.Battery LifeI couldnt test the battery with case in total, but the buds hold up very well.Gestures and MiscThe gestures work very well, and the volume adjustment with this generation is .

5,5,08-02-2024,"Finally got my hands on the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Gen and Im happy that the product is 100 genuine. The sound quality and immersive audio experience have truly impressed me. The Noise Cancellation feature surpasses any other competitor in the market obviously, and it stays snugly in my ear even during intense workouts at the gym.All in all, Im quite satisfied with the product so far. The only minor drawback Id say is that the audio bass could be a bit stronger. Still, the audio quality, the features, the battery life, and the overall fit make it a perfect travel companion.",positive,2,2024,8
6,5,14-10-2023,"The Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Gen offer a outstanding audio experience. Sleek in design, secure fit, aided by customizable silicone tips is an absolute comfort for extended use.

7,1,24-11-2022,"So if you have been ordering apple products on Amazon thinking that youre covered, think again!I ordered a Air Pod Pro gen 2  from Appario Retail.......and recieved a1 opened and resealed box apple seal off, scotch tape on2 dirty internal package3 scrathedbuffed charging case4 clearly used air pods with ear wax on them!5 Not only that, its got a missing ear bud the fresh silicon ones.I tried to put in a repalcement request, and Ive been on hold over the phone for an hour since Amazon doesnt allow for a straight through return replacement in apples case,AND the teams been working hard to let me know that I have a good product and I shouldnt bother about the reused bit their words not mine, and if I do insist, the only option is to go to Apple Store for a resolution .With no defect, only the fact that its a returned  resuedpartial parts product resold to me at full price, it doesnt take much to understand what Apples response will be.Thats the last time Im buying a apple product from Amazon !!!Buyers beware!Btw, the hold music is not bad, and one just has to ignore the fact or not that they are violating Department of Telecom guidelines with their VOIP calls using a UK number from an India location.P.S the support call was terminated after having been on hold for a reaaallly long time! Wow ! Incompetence!",negative,11,2022,24

10,4,26-07-2023,"Its just good! If you are an apple user this works like charm! I love the little animation on dynamic island each time this gets connected to my iPhone 14 pro max. Battery back up is good compared to my other TWS ear buds. Sound quality is good, bass level is well balanced and music notes are crisp! Best feature of this ear buds must be the noise cancellation. It immediately transfers you to a different world as soon as you activate noise cancellation! Transparency mode is very useful in many situation  I really love adaptive transparency mode especially while riding motorcycle on a windy day. Smart message announcement, feedback features are really admirable.Only problem I have faced is it doesnt connect to Apple Watch ultra automatically when you leave your phone back. There seems to be a bug which confuses ear buds to go into transparency mode as soon as you play music on watch. Also the music pauses abruptly on watch. Currently the solution for this situation is to turnoff  turnon the Bluetooth on watch to refresh the connection.Except this problem, I just love these amazing piece of tech!",positive,7,2023,26
11,5,19-10-2023,"With the 5k10k TWS  ANC segment crowded  extremely VFM, it was getting harder to justify the Airpods Pro. The Pro 2 with the latest firmware truly transforms the usability quotient  setting them distinctly apart from the Samsungs  the 1s and even SennheisersMarshalls. 5 hours of talktime  music playback is superb  with the case lasts the entire working day. Magsafe charging is an added benefit  tops up in 30mins. The adaptive  transparency ANC mode is superbly done with no distortion. If you have ANC headphones for your flights, you wont need them anymore. Its that good!The Spatial Audio with head tracking works superbly with Apple Music but for your Spotify or on device music, its a gimmick. I guess its understandable as the support requires to be there from the streaming service as well. Device switching is seamless and no fiddling required.Just from the sound perspective, they are not comparable with the ones from Shure, Klipsch or even their Beats Studios as the Airpods sound more Neutral to appeal to a larger group. But its the all round feature set for the price is what makes them a great pair to own  experience.",positive,10,2023,19

15,5,07-08-2023,"I was using AirPods Pro 1st Generation since mid2020. Lately they had begun to show issues like mic input not coming in clearly  some occasional audio artifacts. Enough to make me wonder if I should get the new 2nd Gen AirPods Pro.Finally gave in and got them. It has only been a few days but I can feel the difference and boy does it feel good! The noise cancellation is sooo much better, and the sound quality is excellent cant say if thats because my older set was... old, or if the new product has significantly better sound, or both.Too soon to make much commentary on battery life but based on what Ive read that seems to have been improved as well. Also appreciate the much improved abilities with Find My  the ability of the case to make beeping noises, and of the phone to show me arrow directions to find the thing.I took an AppleCare plan on this too, in case something goes awry  you can get that by contacting Apple Support directly these days, if visiting the store isnt convenient.1010 will recommend the upgrade.",positive,8,2023,7
16,5,18-02-2024,"Okay! So,i paid for this product is 23500 which is a hefty amount for me! But the features it unlocks, the experience is so different, i think each of you should have it once in a life! Like, the noice cancellation is 55, connectivity 55 ,transparency 45 and the most important sound quality i consider the bass is a little bit lower but and this but is huge because when you listen the music in high res audio my god that is so amazing! If you have money and an iphone again i will repeat an iphone then purchase it immediately but if you dont have an iphone then dont consider it once instead purchase sony xm400 or whatever they are.Ab mai chala soone byeeee",negative,2,2024,18
17,5,13-10-2023,Its original AirPods Pro second gen no doubt about it. It comes with 1 year warranty confirmed by Apple support. It also updated to the latest firmware if thats not enough I dont know what is.But its the lightning version not the usb c version Amazon should mention it in the TITLE as they do on other countries versions of Amazon. This is however mentioned in the description so I knew what I was getting before I paid.At a price of 18.5k there is no place you can get it cheaper and its absolutely worth it no doubt. And its double worth it if you have an iPhone 14 or below because of they dont have usb c anyway. The new usb c model is absolutely identical to this one except for the port. If you have and iPhone 15 or above go for the new one I would say.,negative,10,2023,13
18,4,13-02-2024,"Highly recommended for ecosystem. Seamless connection with iPhone and MacBook. Honestly subpar sound quality if compared with Sony wf xm4 and 5. But surprisingly when in spatial mode, we can see significant improvement in sound staging and quality. Can be placed on the same page as xm4,5 when spatial audio is on. Battery backup could have been better. Overall satisfied.",negative,2,2024,13
19,4,20-10-2023,"Apple does what it promises. I really needed some good earphones for calling. I was not expecting the bundle of features it came with and quality would be so good and useful. No one can beat the noise cancellation feature. Spatial audio is also very nice. Mic quality is awesome. I tested calling while on the bike, running, at gym and bar where there was lot of disturbance but these earphones took care of everything. Please check your product carefully. For me, it was not properly sealed. I hope there wont be any issue with these pair.",positive,10,2023,20
20,5,08-04-2024,"These are the best noise cancelling truly wireless earbuds out there. Absolutely worth every penny . Experience Spatial Audio on this was like a dream.It engulfs you in that wide soundstage which seems much larger than the size of the drivers used in these earbuds. The quality of sound is way above anything else on the market right now. That being said, like every other apple product, you can completely enjoy all the features if you are using an iPhone else features like Spatial Audio doesnt work",positive,4,2024,8
21,4,29-10-2023,After seeing so many negative reviews on Google about this seller i was bit confused but getting them on cheap price i took the risk today i got my original airpods pro 2 generation with warranty n everything they send me in shoe box first impression was like i m ded now  but then I opened it got the airpods inside the shoe box  second generation pro airpods are much much better than first one definitely recommend go get them,positive,10,2023,29
22,4,18-01-2024,"Everything was good. The product is original the quality is good. But the warranty is not for 1 year. Amazon and the seller has mentioned it is for 1 year.

The battery life is significantly better than the first gen, it retains battery life better when its idle. The sound signature is leaps better than the previous gen with excellent low, mids and highs.The case has undergone upgrades as well and can be charged with an apple watch puck and other magsafe chargers. It supports find my and has an U1 chip. The noise cancellation is excellent for a device this small.

25,4,06-12-2023,"Dont get confused thinking this is 2nd gen AirPods pro with type C connectivity. This is lightning cable connectivity and hence the price. Apart from that the product is great. Adaptive transparency, conversation awareness is a game changer on a daily basis.They could have worked on the dust proof side of things better.

I felt cheated but decided to keep the AirPods as I was travelling and the return would have been problematic.",negative,1,2024,8
28,4,25-06-2023,So earlier I was facing this issue of serial number mismatch on device and invoice. Due to this there was no valid purchase date on apples site. But after contacting the social media team they were able to provide correct invoice. Finally was able to get the warranty date updated. I assume telephonic support really never understood what was the issue and due to that there was one month long back n forth.Overall thanks Amazon. And product is amazing worth 5 star but deducting 1 for the hassle Ive gone through for getting correct warranty date for my newly purchased airpods.,negative,6,2023,25

ANC is world class a pin drop silent, suitable for Travel and for all kinds of noises.

31,3,10-04-2024,"Just 9 months into the purchase of my AirPods Pro 2, Ive visited the service centre twice. I was facing microphone issues, but the service Centre just replaced the drivers within the pods. Fast forward next month, my left AirPod just refuses to charge within the case. Upon inspection by the service centre guys, the result came out that the charging point inside the case had been damaged due to it catching rust from sweat.

I have even used AirPods Max and found them too bright but these are perfect. Bass is not boomy but sufficient enough to enjoy and definitely better than 1st Generation.Id recommend to purchase a silicon case for it because its glossy surface is prone to scratches even if youre using it carefully.Product was delivered on same day with good packing and product was brand new with no issues whatsoever as on date.",positive,11,2022,27

59,2,31-01-2024,"So, before buying these, I had been using Airpods Pro 1st gen, and I was pretty satisfied with those. My father wanted to try them, so I gave mine to him and brought these 2nd gen for myself. Now these are better in almost all points than the previous pros but, and there is a big BUT, I have been encountering sound cracking since the first week of buying them. Also there were some scratches on the case, only visible in bright light. I didnt had any problem like that with the 1st gen. And the major problem is the issue doesnt show immediately after you take them out of the case, it can arise even after 5 minutes or maybe after an hour. Due to this when I took them to Apple service centre, they diagnosed it to be Okay, as the problem is not clearly evident. One of the guys even suggested that keep using them, maybe the problem will increase and then I could get a replacement.The major takeaway? Buy them from offline stores or Apple authorised resellers so that you dont have a shred of doubt about the genuinity of the product.",negative,1,2024,31

72,5,05-11-2022,Tbh if u want better sound quality and noise cancellation go with Sony . But if u are already in the Apple ecosystem then just go for it as it is a much better choice than any other buds when it comes to connectivity. I have used the Sony wf 1000 xm3s every day for the past 2 years during my workout and to be honest the noise cancellation for me was much better on them when compared to Apple . One more thing I would like to add is the comfort on the AirPods Pro is unlike any other buds.,positive,11,2022,5
